CleanHTML
=========

Quick Script to pretty print HTML from command line that uses BeautifulSoup to 
create a new cleanly formatted file.  Nothing fancy here... just something for 
command line noobs to work with.

Requirements
------------

* A compupter
* Python 2.7 or higher

Examples
-------
    
    python /path/to/CleanHTML/cleanit.py /path/to/your/ugly.html

This will create a new file:
    
    /path/to/your/ugly.html.clean

which you can edit, diff, or use to overwrite the existing file.
